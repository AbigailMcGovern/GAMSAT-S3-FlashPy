# GAMSAT-S3-FlashPy
A small python package for automated generation of calculation-requiring MCQs to aid in preparation for GAMSAT section III.

## What this is and is not?

This package does not claim to replicate problem style in the GAMSAT exam. Questions are based on those in introductory univeristy level textbooks and from other GAMSAT study resources. Rather, the aim is to produce problems that use cognitive skills that will be useful in the GAMSAT (i.e., application of formulas and mental arithmatic) in the context of content that may appear in the exam (basic physics, chemistry, biochemistry). The package does not generate theory based questions, but rather produces MCQs for questions in which you need to calculate a solution. 

## NOTES:

- This package is under active development and is not yet functional
- This package and its author are in no way associated with Australian Council of Education Research (ACER) or the Graduate Medical School Admissions Test (GAMSAT). 
- These are personal study resources and are in no way intended for use by others... that said... feel free üòÇ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
